  <Tooltip>Jetpack yaw around gravity axis</Tooltip>
  <Description>A simple plugin which addresses a UX/QoL/Accessibility issue that seems to have been reported many times since 2014. While using a jetpack in any grivity field, it makes the player yaw around the current gravity axis, as if he was standing on the ground.</Description>
